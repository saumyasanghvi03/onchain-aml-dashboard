## 🏆 Ultimate Proof-of-Compliance Workflow

1. Run a compliance check with finAIguard
2. Download your audit CSV log (includes all hashes)
3. Add to IPFS for public, immutable storage (get the content hash URL)
4. (Optional) Store the CSV file or just the hash in a blockchain smart contract for additional timestamped, on-chain proof
